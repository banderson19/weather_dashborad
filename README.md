## Purpose
> This project is going to be a user-friendly game that is compatible on different devices. The game will use an API formatted to retrieve data and trivia from the popular cartoon sitcom known as Rick and Morty and be converted into JSON format. This project will also incorporate the use of modals to prompt different scenarios and character selections to display various images form the APOD API. This API is for fetching data from NASA's APOD website - a popular service showing the most beautiful astronomical photographs in the world. We will be using a basic text entry-adventure game format on Javascript so that we can build state into the application, that way the path can be determined based off of different text nodes and options determined by what the player selects. The result with be an interactive, visual story that is generated.
